        What is this?
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        Hello there! This is a space I decided to use to keep some accessibility insights and knowledge that I acquired
        throughtout the years in the industry and wanted to have them recorded.
        <br><br>
        I will cover a couple of specific topics I'm passionate about, since a lot of good accessibility reports
        from console holders are public and a very good source of information already!
        <br><br>
        I plan to expand and polish this further by adding more images, more examples and more resources!

        Colourblindness
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        When we cover accessibility, colour change and high contrast options are usually the default option we expect
        from a big scope games. It is a fairly common condition and a good friendly colour and contrast can enhance the
        readability and accessibility for everyone!
        <br><br>
        But there isn't really an easy solution to it, and for smaller games where the budget is tighter, coding an
        alternative colour schemes for the UI will increase the scope and maintanance considerably.
        <br><br>
        So understanding how to mitigate colour dependency is the key to create a friendly and accessible colour
        palette!
        <br><br>
        Easier said than done, certainly! Even this website is far from perfect and it only has 4 colours! But it's
        important to acknowledge the problem, and use your good designer sense(which is asking others for opinion) to
        mitigate it as much as you can.

        Start with Contrast
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        Contrast is the universal tool of an accessible UI! it doesn't rely on colours, makes everything more readable
        and can direct the eye for a nice and elegant visual hierarchy.
        <br><br>
        So before adding any colour to differentiate your on/off toggles, warnings or positive feedback, try to work
        with the right contrast to convey the same message.
        <br><br>
        A lower contrast between the text and its container can express disabled states, placeholder text for inputs, a
        toggled off switch and so much more. The same way a higher contrast can convey focused states, an important
        warning or just a very good way to keep your UI easy to read.

        Understanding Fonts
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        Fonts are a very complex and hard subject, so I'll cover the very basics for a general use accessible UI.
        <br><br>
        We have access to a unlimited amount of paid and free fonts online, as well as open source fonts with multiple
        language support. You can even make your own font if needed!
        <br><br>
        But when it comes to accessibility, we have to limit ourselves and choose from a limited, yet still impressively
        vast amount of fonts that support certain features like supplement latin glyphs (Fa&ccedil;ade,
        R&eacute;sum&eacute;, Se&ntilde;or etc.) and fonts for different alphabets (Japanese, Hangul, Cyrillic
        etc.)
        <br><br>
        Not only it needs to support the language your developing to, but also think of how you want them to look like!
        But keep in mind that sans serif fonts are generaly favoured as a more accessible choice!
      </div>
    </div>

        Format your texts
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        Once you've chosen a suitable font for all your needs, it's time to adjust them for you game's needs!
        <br><br>
        The recommended minimum font size for consoles games are 26px for 1080p, with an option to scale up for larger
        resolution if your UI is not scaling to match the higher resolutions.
        <br><br>
        But also it's important to remember to use a larger space between the each text lines, also known as line
        height. The simple rule is to use 1.5x height for any paragraph longer than 2 lines of text!
        <br><br>
        For example: for 30px size font, aim to use a 45px line height(30&times;1.5)
      </div>
    </div>

        Readability is key!
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        The key to a successful text is not only in the font itself, but how to fit them perfectly in your particular
        puzzle.
        <br><br>
        When displaying a large paragraph, avoid using justified or centre aligned text. Left/Right aligned block of
        text is much easier to read due to the clear anchor point and an even spacing between the words.
        <br><br>
        Avoid Title case text for any labels longer than a couple words (Title Case Is When Every Word Starts With A
        Capital Letter Like This). and if you are thinking about using UPPERCASE to commucate yelling, or just a
        highlight, not all alphabet has different casing for each letter! Consider using <b>Bold</b> or
        something different (but again, try not to rely solely on colours!)
        <br><br>
        And lastly, try to keep your lines no longer than 80 characters long (or around 40 if your language doesn't have
        space between words or are full-width glyphs like Japanese, Korean and Chinese). Long lines can break the
        player's neck trying to read the whole sentence!
